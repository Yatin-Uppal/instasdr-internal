    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] first-letter:text-8xl first-letter:font-bold mb-10">
      Back in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of Digital Gardening. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.
    </Paragraph>

      My <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">small collection</a> highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "should be.” It's an ethos that is both classNameically old and newly imagined.

      <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
        Let's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a digital garden is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
        Tracing back how <a href="#" className="underline text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)]">Neologisms</a> are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us – we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.

      <Heading className="common-heading">The Early Gardens of Hypertext</Heading>
      <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
        Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd – the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
        While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

      To put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      The early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">WikiGnomes.</a> The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites.

    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      The early web debates around this became known as <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline"><em>The Navigation Problem</em></a>  – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences.

    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      After Mark's essay the term <b>digital gardening</b> goes quiet for nearly a decade.

    <Heading className="common-heading">Digital Puttering on Twitter</Heading>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term "<b>digital gardening</b>", but defined it as "<i>faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people</i>"
    </Paragraph>
    <div className="border border-[rgb(207, 217, 222)] rounded-md min-h-28 flex items-center justify-center mb-4 lg:mb-9">Twitter Box</div>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe <b>digital maintenance - the act of cleaning up one's digital space.</b> The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      The garden is our counterbalance. <b>Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.</b> Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Bolshevism</a> to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Celestial Mechanics</a> to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Dunbar's Number</a>. It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. <b>The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.</b>

      <Paragraph className="text-[22px] lg:text-[36px] leading-[var(--leading-base)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-center">

    <Heading className="common-heading">Carrying on Caufield</Heading>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      Tom Critchlow's 2018 article <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens</a> was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add campfires to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Cozy Web</a> areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      Joel also added Amy Hoy's <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">How the Blog Broke the Web</a> post to the pile of influential ideas that led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Moveable Type</a>).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      Amy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the "backChronological Sort Era". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.

    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      Many people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla web formats and layouts we now for granted.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">
      Over the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Digital Gardening Terms of Service</a>. Anne-Laure Le Cunff published a popular guide to setting up <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">No-code Digital Gardens</a>.

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  Many of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites – either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  The current state of web development helped here too. While it feels like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Netlify</a> and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Vercel</a> have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Jekyll</a>, <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Gatsby</a>, <a href="#">11ty</a> and Next make it easier to build sophisticated websites that auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load time, images, and SEO.  These services are trying to find a happy middle ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  While developers were the first on the scene, plenty of writers, researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts have been drawn to the idea of digital gardening. To help folks without programming skills join in, there's been a surge in templates and platforms that allow people to build their own digital gardens without touching a ton of code. I've written an entire guide to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks</a> if you fall into that category.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  Tools like <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Obsidian</a>, <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">TiddlyWiki</a>, and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Notion</a> are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Bi-Directional Links</a>, footnotes, and visual graphs.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">information architecture</a> and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count," as "real" gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and associative links; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  This runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs: posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication date.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared context.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  One of the best ways to do this is through <a href="#" className="text-[#008ba3] underline">Bi-Directional Links –</a> links that make both the destination page and the source page visible to the reader. This makes it easy to move between related content.

  Gardens are never finished, they're <strong>constantly growing, evolving, and changing.</strong> Just like a real soil, carrot, and cabbage garden.

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  The isn't how we usually think about writing on the web. Over the last decade, we've moved away from casual live journal entries and formalised our writing into articles and essays. These are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to the printer.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  This is odd considering editability is one of the main selling points of the web. Gardens lean into this – there is no "final version" on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
  Gardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a pattern in your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence, consider counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who else has thunk such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do your homework and critically think about it over time.

  Putting anything imperfect and half-written on an "official website" may feel strange.
