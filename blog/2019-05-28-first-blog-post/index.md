It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.</p>
        <div className="border border-[rgb(207, 217, 222)] rounded-md min-h-28 flex items-center justify-center mb-4 lg:mb-9">Twitter Box</div>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">My <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">small collection</a> highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.</p>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1616170717/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/growth-leaves_gtdalf.png" className="w-full my-12" alt="" />
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "should be.” It's an ethos that is both classNameically old and newly imagined.</p>

            <h4 className="common-heading"><a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-black)]">A Brief History of Digital Gardens</a></h4>
            <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Let's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a digital garden is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.</p>
            <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Tracing back how <a href="#" className="underline text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)]">Neologisms</a> are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us – we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.</p>
            <h4 className="common-heading">The Early Gardens of Hypertext</h4>
            <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd – the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.</p>
            <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.</p>

        <p className="block text-center my-8 text-lg">Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">To put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">The early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">WikiGnomes.</a> The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites. These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">The early web debates around this became known as <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline"><em>The Navigation Problem</em></a>  – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.</p>
        <blockquote className="w-4/5 border-none mx-auto relative my-20 py-7 after:absolute after:w-16 after:h-[2px] after:bg-[black] after:left-0 after:right-0 after:top-0 after:opacity-10 after:mx-auto before:absolute before:w-16 before:h-[2px] before:bg-[black] before:left-0 before:right-0 before:bottom-0 before:opacity-10 before:mx-auto"><p className="text-[22px] lg:text-[36px] leading-[var(--leading-base)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-center">"Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes"</p></blockquote>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">After Mark's essay the term <b>digital gardening</b> goes quiet for nearly a decade.</p>
        <h4 className="common-heading">Digital Puttering on Twitter</h4>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term "<b>digital gardening</b>", but defined it as "<i>faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people</i>"</p>      
        <div className="border border-[rgb(207, 217, 222)] rounded-md min-h-28 flex items-center justify-center mb-4 lg:mb-9">Twitter Box</div>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe <b>digital maintenance - the act of cleaning up one's digital space.</b> The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">These people were <b>digital puttering</b> more than gardening.</p>
        <div className="border border-[rgb(207, 217, 222)] rounded-md min-h-28 flex items-center justify-center mb-4 lg:mb-9">Twitter Box</div>
        <div className="border border-[rgb(207, 217, 222)] rounded-md min-h-28 flex items-center justify-center mb-4 lg:mb-9">Twitter Box</div>        
        <div className="border border-[rgb(207, 217, 222)] rounded-md min-h-28 flex items-center justify-center mb-4 lg:mb-9">Twitter Box</div>        
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Since none of these folks reference to the earlier nineties notion of <b>digital gardening</b>, or mention issues of hypertext navigation, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these people probably belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.</p>
        <h4 className="common-heading">Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors</h4>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>. It later becomes <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. <b>If anyone should be considered the original source of <em>digital gardening,</em> it's Caufield.</b> They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a <b>different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information</b> - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by <em>streams</em> – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events. The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">This is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">But streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. </p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">The garden is our counterbalance. <b>Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.</b> Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Bolshevism</a> to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Celestial Mechanics</a> to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Dunbar's Number</a>. It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. <b>The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.</b></p>
        <blockquote className="w-4/5 mx-auto relative my-20 py-7 after:absolute after:w-16 after:h-[2px] after:bg-[black] after:left-0 after:right-0 after:top-0 after:opacity-10 after:mx-auto before:absolute before:w-16 before:h-[2px] before:bg-[black] before:left-0 before:right-0 before:bottom-0 before:opacity-10 before:mx-auto"><p className="text-[22px] lg:text-[36px] leading-[var(--leading-base)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-center">"The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."</p></blockquote>
        <h4 className="common-heading">Carrying on Caufield</h4>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Tom Critchlow's 2018 article <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens</a> was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add campfires to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Cozy Web</a> areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.</p>   
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Joel also added Amy Hoy's <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">How the Blog Broke the Web</a> post to the pile of influential ideas that led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Moveable Type</a>).</p>       
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Amy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the "backChronological Sort Era". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.</p>
        <blockquote className="w-4/5 mx-auto relative my-20 py-7 after:absolute after:w-16 after:h-[2px] after:bg-[black] after:left-0 after:right-0 after:top-0 after:opacity-10 after:mx-auto before:absolute before:w-16 before:h-[2px] before:bg-[black] before:left-0 before:right-0 before:bottom-0 before:opacity-10 before:mx-auto"><p className="text-[22px] lg:text-[36px] leading-[var(--leading-base)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-center">"Suddenly people weren’t creating homepages or even web pages... they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page."</p></blockquote>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Many people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla web formats and layouts we now for granted.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">Over the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Digital Gardening Terms of Service</a>. Anne-Laure Le Cunff published a popular guide to setting up <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">No-code Digital Gardens</a>. The IndieWeb community hosted a <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">pop-up session</a> to discuss the history of commonplace books, personal wikis, and memory palaces.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-10">By late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">a short piece</a> on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment when a Twitter buzzword has "made it."</p>

        <h4 className="common-heading">Developer-led Gardening</h4>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">Many of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites – either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">The current state of web development helped here too. While it feels like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Netlify</a> and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Vercel</a> have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Jekyll</a>, <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Gatsby</a>, <a href="#">11ty</a> and Next make it easier to build sophisticated websites that auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load time, images, and SEO.  These services are trying to find a happy middle ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">While developers were the first on the scene, plenty of writers, researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts have been drawn to the idea of digital gardening. To help folks without programming skills join in, there's been a surge in templates and platforms that allow people to build their own digital gardens without touching a ton of code. I've written an entire guide to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks</a> if you fall into that category.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">Tools like <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Obsidian</a>, <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">TiddlyWiki</a>, and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Notion</a> are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Bi-Directional Links</a>, footnotes, and visual graphs.</p>
        <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">information architecture</a> and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count,” as "real” gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.</p>

            1. Topography over Timelines
          </h4>
          <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
            Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and
            associative links; the concepts and themes within each note
            determine how it's connected to others.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
            This runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs:
            posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication
            date.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
            Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail
            of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they
            aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden.
            Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes,
            topics, and shared context.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">

            links that make both the destination page and the source page
            visible to the reader. This makes it easy to move between related
            content.

            Because garden notes are densely linked, a garden explorer can enter

            The isn't how we usually think about writing on the web. Over the
            last decade, we've moved away from casual live journal entries and
            formalised our writing into articles and essays. These are carefully
            crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's
            done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off

            This is odd considering editability is one of the main selling
            points of the web. Gardens lean into this – there is no "final

            Gardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you
            first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a
            pattern in your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence,
            consider counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who
            else has thunk such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do
            your homework and critically think about it over time.

            In performance-blog-land you do that thinking and researching

          </p>
          <p className="leading-[var(--leading-looser)] text-[var(--color-black)] text-[22px] mb-6">
            In garden-land, that process of researching and refining happens on
            the open internet. You post ideas while they're still "seedlings,”
            and tend them regularly until they're fully grown, respectable
            opinions.

                className="absolute top-2 left-0"
              />
              You're freed from the pressure to get everything right
              immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your

              It's <em>low friction</em>. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual

            Gardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds

            Digital gardens should be just as unique and particular as their
            vegetative counterparts. The point of a garden is that it's a
            personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and
            mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone
            else's standardised template.

            Ideally, this involves experimenting with the native languages of
            the web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're the most flexible and
            robust tools we have for building interconnected knowledge online.
            Gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a
            <em>'personal website'</em>, and make space for weirder, wilder
            experiments.

            That said, I should acknowledge that jumping into full-on web
            development is simply beyond the abilities and interests of many
            people. There is still room for personalisation and play if you're
            using a pre-made template or service – it'll just be within the

            One goal of these hyper-personalised gardens is deep
            <strong>contextualisation</strong>. The overwhelming lesson of the
            Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping millions of people together
            into decontextualised social spaces is a shit show. Devoid of any
            established social norms and abstracted from our specific cultural
            identities, we end up in awkward, aggravating exchanges with people
            who are socially incoherent to us. We know nothing of their lives,
            backgrounds, or belief systems, and have to assume the worst.
            Twitter only offers us a 240 character bio. Facebook pre-selects the
            categories it deems important about you – relationship status,
            gender, hometown.

            Independently owning your garden helps you plan for long-term

            technologies will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and
            widely used web native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet. Backing
            up your notes as flat markdown files won't hurt either.

            Keeping your garden on the open web also sets you up to take part in

            there's an enthusiastic community of developers and designers trying
            to fix that. It's hard to say what kind of libraries, frameworks,
            and design patterns might emerge out of that effort, but it
            certainly isn't going to happen behind a Medium paywall.
