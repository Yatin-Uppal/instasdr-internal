  <BlogParagraph>
    Back in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of Digital Gardening. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <TwitterBox />

  <BlogParagraph>
    My <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">small collection</a> highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogParagraph>
    They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogParagraph>
    A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.
  </BlogParagraph>

    alt="Growth Leaves Illustration"
  />

  <BlogParagraph>
    It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "should be." It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.

  <BlogSection title="A Brief History of Digital Gardens">
    <BlogParagraph>
      Let's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a digital garden is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Tracing back how <a href="#" className="underline text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)]">Neologisms</a> are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us – we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogSubsection title="The Early Gardens of Hypertext">
      <BlogParagraph>
        Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd – the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

  <BlogParagraph>
    To put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogParagraph>
    The early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">WikiGnomes.</a> The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites. These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogParagraph>
    The early web debates around this became known as <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">The Navigation Problem</a>  – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogQuote quote="Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes" />

  <BlogParagraph>
    While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogParagraph>
    After Mark's essay the term <b>digital gardening</b> goes quiet for nearly a decade.
  </BlogParagraph>

  <BlogSubsection title="Digital Puttering on Twitter">
    <BlogParagraph>
      In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term "<b>digital gardening</b>", but defined it as "<i>faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people</i>"
    </BlogParagraph>

    <TwitterBox />

    <BlogParagraph>
      The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe <b>digital maintenance - the act of cleaning up one's digital space.</b> The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      These people were <b>digital puttering</b> more than gardening.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <TwitterBox />

    <BlogParagraph>
      Since none of these folks reference to the earlier nineties notion of <b>digital gardening</b>, or mention issues of hypertext navigation, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these people probably belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.

  <BlogSubsection title="Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors">
    <BlogParagraph>
      At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>. It later becomes <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. <b>If anyone should be considered the original source of digital gardening, it's Caufield.</b> They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a <b>different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information</b> - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by streams – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events. The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      This is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      But streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      The garden is our counterbalance. <b>Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.</b> Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Bolshevism</a> to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Celestial Mechanics</a> to <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Dunbar's Number</a>. It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. <b>The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.</b>
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogQuote quote="The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It's the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another." />

  </BlogSubsection>

  <BlogSubsection title="Carrying on Caufield">
    <BlogParagraph>
      Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Tom Critchlow's 2018 article <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens</a> was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add campfires to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-medium-sea-blue)] underline">Cozy Web</a> areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Joel also added Amy Hoy's <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">How the Blog Broke the Web</a> post to the pile of influential ideas that led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Moveable Type</a>).
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Amy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the "backChronological Sort Era". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogQuote quote="Suddenly people weren't creating homepages or even web pages... they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page." />

    <BlogParagraph>
      Many people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla web formats and layouts we now for granted.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      Over the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">Digital Gardening Terms of Service</a>. Anne-Laure Le Cunff published a popular guide to setting up <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">No-code Digital Gardens</a>. The IndieWeb community hosted a <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">pop-up session</a> to discuss the history of commonplace books, personal wikis, and memory palaces.
    </BlogParagraph>

    <BlogParagraph>
      By late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">a short piece</a> on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment when a Twitter buzzword has "made it."

      What made our current historical moment the right time for digital gardening to take off?
    </BlogParagraph>
    
    <BlogParagraph>
      The timing coincided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and reimagining tools for blogging. The scene was ripe for new ideas around curating and sharing personal knowledge online.
    </BlogParagraph>
    
    <BlogParagraph>
      Many of the people who jumped on the early digital gardening bandwagon were part of communities like...
    </BlogParagraph>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <BlogParagraph>
          The <a href="#" className="text-[var(--color-bright-crimson)] underline">IndieWeb</a> collective – a group that has been championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook for nearly a decade.
        </BlogParagraph>
      </li>
      <li>
        <BlogParagraph>

  <BlogSubsection title="Developer-led Gardening">
    <BlogParagraph>
      Many of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites – either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.
